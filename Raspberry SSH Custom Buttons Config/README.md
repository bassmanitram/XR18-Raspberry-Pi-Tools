# Raspberry SSH Custom Buttons

This is the android app I use for setting up three buttons so the sound guys only have to hit the start record button at the appropriate time.

Find it on the store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.knowles_online.raspberryssh&hl=en)

Pay for it! Firstly the config in this directory tree uses three buttons; secondly the guy is worth rewarding!
