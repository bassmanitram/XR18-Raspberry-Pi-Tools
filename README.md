# XR18-Raspberry-Pi-Tools

A set of tools that make it easy to manage recording from, and mixing of, an XR18
from the same tablet.

These are particularly useful for our church services, where

* We keep the XR18 off the church WiFi and internet access (so, private)
* We need non-experienced people to hit a "Start Recording" button to start recording, and
a "Stop Recording" button to stop recording.
* We don't want to confuse the issue with multiple hardware requirements - one tablet, two apps!
